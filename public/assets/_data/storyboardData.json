A household address might indicate one's citizenship, but this doesn't necessarily tell you where the home is. Social responsibility, though, would be more bounded to the actual place and society where the individual is physically located. This could be a different place from where one's citizenship indicates. All these multifaceted elements and more, would shape one's identity.

When I was in middle school, a schoolmate and I both got caught wearing sports outfits to school (which was not allowed according to school rules). I was brought to the vice principal and penalized even though I had a sound reason but the other girl would walk straight to class without any interference because she was the captain of a school team which was winning multiple competitions at that time. Funny enough, I was also part of the team, but only too new for the vice principal to recognize me at that time.
