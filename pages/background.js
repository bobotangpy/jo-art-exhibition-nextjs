            With the absence of effort to decolonize its one hundred and fifty
            years of British rule, a distrust of the local and the central
            government, and a sense of superiority over the mainland Chinese and
            more, Hong Kong people feel hopeless while the city struggles to
            maintain its unique disposition and status amid China and the
            world’s rapid development. The series of protests since 2003
            reacting to China-related issues, policies and legislations are
            essentially outcries of citizens suffocating in the muddy floods of
            ideological conflicts, moral dilemmas, and identity confusion. Some
            believe we ought to be personally responsible citizens therefore all
            acts of violence shall not be justified; some see being personally
            responsible is not enough and that joining protests is a means to
            exhibit themselves as participatory citizens; and some argue civil
            disobedience and violence is the only way for justice-oriented
            citizens to confront systematic oppression. But ultimately, what
            kind of citizens and society do we want? (Westheimer &amp; Kahne,
            2004)

            This proposed art exhibition, an independent website, seeks to
            address the civil identity complex in Hong Kong. Including artworks
            from local artists/educators and students, collages of local and
            global headlines and artworks, short video clips, audio recordings
            of local musicians improvising to express their emotions towards the
            city’s situation, and interactive storyboards, the exhibition’s goal
            is to spark discussions and reflections on: (1) the concepts of
            home, identity, citizenship, and social responsibility; (2) the
            interplay and struggles among these concepts and with education
            under an unstable socio-political environment; and (3) the role of
            education among these concepts under modern globalization.

            The significance of this exhibition is manifold. Firstly, Hong Kong
            presents an interesting case on how an international, capitalistic
            hub in Asia wrestles with its fate of transforming from a former
            British colony with some degree of democratic participation into a
            socialistic society: What does this change mean to the locals
            regarding the concepts of citizenship and social responsibility? How
            are the people behaving and feeling towards the changes? The arts, a
            genuine medium to explore human emotions, self-identity and
            aspiration, serves as a wonderful alternative to examine the
            context. Secondly, the past fifteen months have often been described
            as Hong Kong people’s “collective political awakening”. The
            exhibition serves as a precious, artistic, inclusive record of a
            period of momentous change in the Hong Kong society. Furthermore, it
            is extremely crucial to offer the international community a local
            context with diverse views on a complex social issue as we emphasize
            the reflection on the meaning of local and global citizenship and
            social responsibility. Through the exhibition, the audience are
            invited to see through different lenses, feel with different
            narratives, and reflect and imagine with creativity.
